\noindent{\bf Random Variables and Probability Distributions.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Random Variables.} Consider the following game: you roll two standard 6-sided dice, one after the other. If the number on the first dice divides the number on the second dice, you get 1 point. You get 1 additional point for each prime number you roll.

Define the random variable $R_1$ to be the result of the first roll, and define $R_2$ to be the result of the second roll. Define the random variable $X = R_1 + R_2$ to be the sum of the numbers that come up on both dice, define the random variable $Y = R_1 \cdot R_2$ to be the product of the numbers that come up on both dice, and define the random variable $Z$ to be the number of points you win in the game.

\begin{enumerate}
\item How many values can the random variable $Z$ take on (with nonzero probability)?
\begin{Freeform}{3}
\# values of $Z$ =

\end{Freeform}
%-----------------------------------------
\item What are the minimum and maximum values that the random variable $Z$ take on  (with nonzero probability)? Please enter your answer in the form $(x,y)$ where $x$ is the minimum value and $y$ is the maximum value (be sure not to use a space!).

\end{Freeform}

\item Conditioned on the fact that your second roll is a 1, what is the probability that $Z = 1$? Please enter your answer as a completely reduced fraction (i.e. in the form $x/y$ where $x,y$ are the smallest possible non-negative integers).
\begin{Freeform}{2/3}

\item Conditioned on the fact that your second roll is a 1, what is the probability that $Z = 2$?  Please enter your answer as a completely reduced fraction (i.e. in the form $x/y$ where $x,y$ are the smallest possible non-negative integers).

\item {\bf A Preview of Expectations.} Consider a random variable $X$ which takes on values $x_1, \ldots, x_n$. The \emph{expectation} of $X$, denoted $\E[X]$, is defined to be 
\[
\E[X] = \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i \cdot \Prob[X = x_i].
\]
Notice that when $\Prob[X = x_i] = \frac{1}{n}$ for all $i$, then this is simply the familiar notion of an average! You will learn more about the expectation next week, and you can refer to note 12 for more details. For now, we will practice calculating some expectations.

Let us return to the game from the first question: roll two 6-sided dice, award 1 point if the number on the first dice divides the number on the second dice, plus one more point for each prime. Define $R_1$ to be the result of the first roll, define $R_2$ to be the result of the second roll, define $X = R_1 + R_2$ to be the sum of the numbers that come up on both dice, define $Y = R_1 \cdot R_2$ to be the product of the numbers that come up on both dice, and define $Z$ to be the number of points you win in the game.

\item What is $\E[R_1]$?
\begin{Freeform}{3.5}
$\E[R_1]$ = 
\Hint Review the definition of expectation.
\end{Freeform}
%-----------------------------------------
\item What is $\E[X] = \E[R_1 + R_2]$?
\begin{Freeform}{7}
$\E[X]$ = 
\Hint Review the definition of expectation.
\end{Freeform}
%-----------------------------------------
\item What is $\E[2\cdot R_1]$? What do you notice about this expectation?
\begin{Freeform}{7}
$\E[X]$ = 
\Hint Review the definition of expectation.
\end{Freeform}
%-----------------------------------------
\item What is $\E[Z | R_2 = 1]$, the expected number of points we win conditioned on the fact that the second dice roll is a 1? Please enter your answer as a completely reduced fraction (i.e. in the form $x/y$ where $x,y$ are the smallest possible positive integers).
\begin{Freeform}{2/3}
$\E[Z | R_2 = 1]$ = 
\Hint Review the definition of expectation--here, we are only considering expectation over the sample points in which $R_2 = 1$.
\end{Freeform}
