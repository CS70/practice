\config{name}{Probability Spaces and Conditional Probability}
\noindent{\bf Probability Spaces and Conditional Probability}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose I have a biased coin, with outcomes $H$ and $T$, with the probability of heads $\Prob[H] = \frac{3}{4}$ and the probability of tails $\Prob[T] = \frac{1}{4}$. Suppose I perform an experiment in which I toss the coin 3 times--an outcome of this experiment is $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$, where $X_i \in \{H,T\}$.\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the \textit{sample space} for my experiment?
\begin{Multi}
\begin{enumerate}
\FalseChoice\item $\{H, T\}$
\FalseChoice\item $\{\frac{3}{4}, \frac{1}{4}\}$
\TrueChoice\item $\{(X_1, X_2, X_3) \ s.t. \ X_1, X_2, X_3 \in \{H,T\}\}$
\end{enumerate}
\Hint Review the definition of an sample space in the notes.
\Solution We have three flips, therefore our sample space needs to capture all sequences of length $3$ of possible outcomes.
\end{Multi}
%-----------------------------------------------
\item Which of the following are examples of \textit{events}? Select all that apply.
\begin{Multi}
\begin{enumerate}
\FalseChoice\item $\{(H,H,T), (H,H), (T)\}$
\TrueChoice\item $\{(T, H, H), (H, T, H), (H, H, T), (H, H, H)\}$
\TrueChoice\item $\{(T, T,T)\}$
\TrueChoice\item $\{(T, T, T), (H, H, H)\}$
\TrueChoice\item $\{(T, H, T), (H, H, T)\}$
\end{enumerate}
\Hint Review the definition of an event in the notes.
\Solution Any subset of the sample space is an event. All choices but the first one are valid subsets.
\end{Multi}
%-----------------------------------------------
\item What is the probability of the outcome $H, H, T$? Enter your answer as a fully reduced fraction (i.e. your answer should have the format $x/y$, where $x, y \in \N$ are the smallest possible integers they can be). 
\begin{Freeform}{9/64}
$\Prob[(H,H,T)]$ = 
\Hint Note that the coin tosses are independent, and you know $\Prob[H], \Prob[T]$.
\Solution We need to multiply the probabilities together. We get $\frac{3}{4}\times\frac{3}{4}\times\frac{1}{4}=\frac{9}{64}$.
\end{Freeform}
%-----------------------------------------------
\item What is the probability of the event that my outcome has exactly two heads? Enter your answer as a fully reduced fraction (i.e. your answer should have the format $x/y$, where $x, y \in \N$ are the smallest possible integers they can be). 
\begin{Freeform}{27/64}
$\Prob[$ exactly 2 heads] = 
\Hint Note that the coin tosses are independent, and you know $\Prob[H], \Prob[T]$. How many such outcomes are there, and what is each one's probability? Try a combinatorial approach.
\Solution There are three such outcomes (three places where the single tails can occur). Each such outcome has probability $\frac{9}{64}$ like before. So the total probability is $3\times\frac{9}{64}=\frac{27}{64}$.
\end{Freeform}
\end{enumerate}
\item Consider the drawing of the probability space $S$ below. Here, the blue/purple region is the set of events $B$, the red/purple/orange region is the set of events $R$, and the yellow/orange region is the set of events $Y$. The set of events $P$ is the set of events in both  $B \text{ and } R$, and is represented by the purple region. The set of events $O$ is the set of events in both $R \text{ and } Y$, and is represented by the orange region.

Assume that we are sampling from $S$ uniformly at random. Please answer the following multiple choice questions about this space, selecting all that apply.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is $\Prob[R]$, the probability that an element from $S$ is in $R$?
\begin{Multi}
\Hint Recall the definition of probability--the probability of an event $X$ is the number of outcomes for which $X$ occurs divided by the total number of outcomes. 
\begin{enumerate}
\FalseChoice\item $\frac{|R| - |P| - |O|}{|S|}$
\TrueChoice\item $\frac{|R|}{|S|}$
\FalseChoice\item $|R|$
\end{enumerate}
\Solution Since we are sampling uniformly at random, the probabilities are computed by dividing the number of elements in the event of interest ($R$) by the total number of elements ($S$).
\end{Multi}
%-----------------------------------
\item What is $\Prob[R|Y]$, the probability that an element from $S$ is in $R$ given that it is also in $Y$?
\begin{Multi}
\Hint Recall the definition of probability--the probability of an event $X$ is the number of outcomes for which $X$ occurs divided by the total number of outcomes. When we condition on an event $Z$, we are restricting the total outcomes to be outcomes for which $Z$ occurs.
\begin{enumerate}
\FalseChoice \item $\frac{|O|}{|S|}$
\TrueChoice\item $\frac{|O|}{|Y|}$
\TrueChoice\item $\frac{|R \cap Y|}{|Y|}$
\end{enumerate}
\Solution Conditioning on $Y$ is like considering everything outside of $Y$ as not even being there. So we need to restrict $R$ to $Y$ which gives us $Y\cap R=O$. Then we need to divide the number of elements in that region by $|Y|$ which is our new sample space.
\end{Multi}
%-----------------------------------
\item What is $\Prob[R|O]$, the probability that an element from $S$ is in $R$ given that it is in $O$?
\begin{Multi}
\Hint Recall the definition of probability--the probability of an event $X$ is the number of outcomes for which $X$ occurs divided by the total number of outcomes. When we condition on an event $Z$, we are restricting the total outcomes to be outcomes for which $Z$ occurs.
\begin{enumerate}
\TrueChoice \item 1
\TrueChoice \item $\frac{|R \cap O|}{|O|}$
\FalseChoice\item $\frac{|R \cap O|}{|S|}$
\end{enumerate}
\Solution Like before this probability is equal to $\frac{|R\cap O|}{|O|}$. But note that $O\cap R = O$, so this fraction is just $1$.
\end{Multi}
%-----------------------------------
\item What is $\mathbb{P}[P|B]$, the probability that an element from $S$ is in $P$ given it is in $B$?
\begin{Multi}
\Hint Recall the definition of probability--the probability of an event $X$ is the number of outcomes for which $X$ occurs divided by the total number of outcomes. When we condition on an event $Z$, we are restricting the total outcomes to be outcomes for which $Z$ occurs.
\begin{enumerate}
\FalseChoice\item $\frac{|P|}{|S|}$
\TrueChoice\item $\frac{|P|}{|B|}$
\TrueChoice\item $\frac{|B \cap P|}{|B|}$
\end{enumerate}
\Solution Similar to the previous questions, the answer is $\frac{|B\cap P|}{|B|}$. Note that $P\subseteq B$, so $B\cap P=P$.
\end{Multi}
%-----------------------------------
\item What is $\Prob[B \cup R \cup Y]$, the probability that an element of $S$ is in $B$ or $R$ or $Y$?
\begin{Multi}
\Hint Recall the definition of probability--the probability of an event $X$ is the number of outcomes for which $X$ occurs divided by the total number of outcomes. Be careful not to double count!
\begin{enumerate}
\TrueChoice\item $\frac{|B| + |R| + |Y| - |P| - |O|}{|S|}$
\TrueChoice\item $\frac{|B \setminus P| + |R| + |Y\setminus O|}{|S|}$   \hfill ($X \setminus Z = \{ x \ s.t.\ x \in X\text{ and } x \not\in Z\}$)
\FalseChoice\item $\frac{|B| + |R| + |O|}{|S|}$
\end{enumerate}
\Solution We just need to count and make sure that each region inside the union is counted exactly once. This happens in the first two choices. In the last choice, $O$ is counted twice (once from $R$ and once from $O$) as is $P$. So the last choice is not right.
\end{Multi}
%-----------------------------------
\item What is $\Prob[O | R \cup Y]$, the probability that an element of $S$ is in  $O$ given that it is also in $R$ or $Y$?
\begin{Multi}
\Hint Recall the definition of probability--the probability of an event $X$ is the number of outcomes for which $X$ occurs divided by the total number of outcomes. When we condition on an event $Z$, we are restricting the total outcomes to be outcomes for which $Z$ occurs. Be careful not to double count!
\begin{enumerate}
\FalseChoice\item $\frac{|O|}{|S| - |B|}$
\TrueChoice\item $\frac{|O|}{|Y| + |R| - |O|}$
\FalseChoice\item $\frac{|O|}{|Y| + |R|}$
\end{enumerate}
\Solution $O$ is a subset of $R\cup Y$. So in the numerator we just need $|O|$. In the denominator we need $\Prob[R\cup Y]$. Only the second choice gives us that in the denominator.
\end{Multi}
%-----------------------------------
\end{enumerate}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\item Suppose I have a bag of candy containing 10 chocolate bars, 5 lollipops and 5 toffees. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item If I randomly select a piece of candy to eat, what is the probability that it will be a chocolate bar? Please enter your answer as a decimal. Enter the answer as an exact decimal with a leading zero.
\begin{Freeform}{0.5}
$\Prob[\text{chocolate}]$ = 
\Hint Recall the definition of probability.
\Solution Exactly half of the candies are chocolate bars. So the probability is $1/2$.
\end{Freeform}
%-------------------------------------------
\item Suppose that I am trying to randomly select a candy for a friend who does not like chocolate, so that every time I choose a chocolate I return it to the bag, and I stop when I draw a candy that is not chocolate. What is the probability that I choose a toffee? Enter the answer as an exact decimal with a leading zero.
\begin{Freeform}{0.5}
Probability = 
\Hint Recall the definition of probability--what are we conditioning on?
\Solution Conditioning on the candy not being a chocolate bar, we have a sample space consisting of $5$ lollipops and $5$ toffees. In this space, exactly half of the outcomes are toffees. So the probability is again $1/2$.
\end{Freeform}
%-------------------------------------------
\item Say that I have eaten one chocolate, one toffee, and one lollipop. True or false: now that I have eaten one of each candy, my probability of choosing a chocolate has decreased.
\begin{Choices}
Calculate the probability of drawing a chocolate in the updated bag. 
\begin{itemize}
\FalseChoice\item True
\TrueChoice\item False
\end{itemize}
\Solution In the new space we have $9$ chocolate bars, $4$ toffees and $4$ lollipops. Therefore the new probability of picking a chocolate bar is $9/17$ which is slightly above $1/2$.
\end{Choices}
%-------------------------------------------
\end{enumerate}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\item Suppose you arrange 12 different cars in a parking lot, 
uniformly at random. Three of the cars are Priuses, four of the cars 
are Teslas, and the other five are Nissan Leaves. What is the 
probability that the three Priuses are all together? (round your answer to the 4th decimal place)
\begin{Freeform}{0.0455}
\Solution There are $12!$ possible ways to arrange the 12 cars. Now, there are 
$12 - 3+ 1 = 10$ different places the Priuses could go (positions 
1,2,3, positions 2,3,4, all the way until positions 10,11,12). 
For each of those 10 places, there are 3! ways to arrange the Priuses 
and 9! ways to arrange the other 9 cars in the 9 remaining spots. 
So, in total, there are $10*3!*9!$ ways of arranging the cars so that 
the 3 Priuses are together. So the probability we get what we want is 
$\frac{10*3!*9!}{12! } = .0455$.
\end{Freeform}


\item {\bf Probability Poker}
Suppose we have a deck of 52 cards that is well shuffled. We draw five cards from the deck and call it a hand. For all parts below, round your answer to the 5th decimal place.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability of drawing a hand with four of a kind (four cards of the same rank)?
\begin{Freeform}{0.00024}
\Solution $\frac{13 * 48}{{52 \choose 5}}$. In this approach, we're working over a sample space where the order in which we draw cards doesn't matter (shown in the denominator), so our numerator is counting the number of distinct combinations where order doesn't matter. We choose a rank and this selects 4 cards (13 ways). A poker hand is 5 cards, so to complete the poker hand, we have 48 cards left to choose from.

Alternative approach: we can also work over a sample space where the order the card is drawn does matter. In this approach, the denominator is: ${52 \choose 5} * 5!$. The numerator is: $13 * 12 * 4 * 5!$. Note that this gives us the same answer as the the first approach.
\end{Freeform}


\item What is the probability of drawing a straight (five cards in numerical order)?
\begin{Freeform}{0.00394}
\Solution $\frac{10 * 4^5}{{52 \choose 5}}$. There are 10 possible straights to choose from: {A-5}, {2-6}, {3-7}, ..., {10-A}. For each of those straights, for each number, there are 4 suits to choose from, so there are $4^5$ ways to choose cards. 
\end{Freeform}

\item A super straight is a hand of straight that comes in ascending order. For example, drawing a 3, then 4, then 5, 6, and 7 is called drawing a super straight. What is the probability of drawing a super straight?
\begin{Freeform}{0.00003}
\Solution $\frac{40 * 4^4}{{52 \choose 5} * 5!}$. We have to work in a sample space where order does matter in this problem as the definition of a super straight involves order. The denominator is thus ${52 \choose 5} * 5!$. There are 10 possible straights: {A-5}, {2-6}, {3-7}, ..., {10-A}. So for the first card, you have $10 * 4 = 40$ choices. As the card has to come in ascending order, each of the next 4 cards has 4 choices (4 suits to choose from). So the numerator is $40 * 4^4$. Note that the answer is exactly $1 / 5!$ of the previous part. 
\end{Freeform}

\item What is the probability of drawing a flush (five cards all of the same suit)?
\begin{Freeform}{0.00198}
\Solution $\frac{4 * {13 \choose 5}}{{52 \choose 5}}$. First, choose a suit (4 suits). Then choose 5 cards from each suit which has 13 cards ${13 \choose 5}$. 
\end{Freeform}

\item What is the probability of drawing a straight flush (five cards in numerical order, all of the same suit)?
\begin{Freeform}{0.00002}
\Solution $\frac{4 * 10}{{52 \choose 5}}$. First choose a suit (4 ways). Then choose a straight (10 ways).
\end{Freeform}

\item What is the probability of drawing a hand with exactly one pair (two cards of matching rank)?

\begin{Freeform}{0.42257}
\Solution $ \dfrac{13 * {4 \choose 2} * {12 \choose 3} * 4^3}{{52 \choose 5}}$. Choose a rank for the pair (13 ways) and 2 suits (${4 \choose 2}$ ways). Now we need 3 other cards to complete our poker hand. Since we have exacly one pair, all three are from different ranks. There are 12 ranks left to choose 3 ranks (${12 \choose 3}$ ways) and for each rank there are 4 ways to choose a suit ($4^3$ ways). 
\end{Freeform}
\end{enumerate}

\item Suppose we have a bag with 2 coins. One of them is fake: it has heads on both faces. The other is a normal coin. You pull a coin out of the bag and flip it. It comes up heads. What is the probability that this coin is the fake one? (Express your answer as a fraction)

\begin{Freeform}{2/3}
\Solution Approach 1: Define event A as drawing the fake coin. Define event B as the coin that we flipped coming up heads. We want to find $P(A|B)$. Using Bayes' Rule,
$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\bar{A})P(\bar{A})} = \frac{1 * \frac{1}{2}}{1 * \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{2}{3}$

 Approach 2: There are 6 possible outcomes which are all equally likely. We have $2$ choices for the coin that we draw (which we represent by $HH$, $HT$ ). Then for each coin we have two choices, we either see the first side or the second side (which we represent by $1$ and $2$). So the outcomes are $\Omega =\{(HH, 1), (HH, 2), (HT, 1), (HT, 2)\}$. Now given that we saw a heads, we can get rid of $1$ of the outcomes, and the possible remaining outcomes are $\{(HH, 1), (HH, 2), (HT, 1)\}$ which are all equally likely. In this space, the event that the coin has two heads is $\{(HH, 1), (HH, 2)\}$ which consists of two equally likely outcomes. So the probability is $2/3$.
\end{Freeform}


\item A lie detector is known to be $4/5$ reliable when the person is guilty
and $9/10$ reliable when the person is innocent. If a suspect is chosen
from a group of suspects of which only $1/100$ have ever committed a 
crime, and the test indicates that the person is guilty, what is the 
probability that he is guilty?

\begin{Freeform}{8/107}
Let $I_G$ denote the event that the test indicates that the person is guilty, and $G$ the event that the person is actually guilty. Note that
$$\Pr[G]=\frac{1}{100},\quad \Pr[\overline{G}]=\frac{99}{100},\quad \Pr[I_G\mid G]=\frac{4}{5},\quad \Pr[I_G\mid\overline{G}]=\frac{1}{10}.
$$

By Bayes' Rule and the Total Probability Rule the desired probability is
$$\Pr[G\mid I_G]= \frac{\Pr[G]\Pr[I_G\mid G]}{\Pr[I_G]}=\frac{\Pr[G]\Pr[I_G\mid G]}{\Pr[G]\Pr[I_G\mid G]+\Pr[\overline{G}]\Pr[I_G\mid \overline G]}=\frac{(1/100)(4/5)}{(1/100)(4/5) + (99/100)(1/10)} = \frac{8}{107}$$
\end{Freeform}



\item {\bf Bayesian Inference.} In this problem, we will work through an example of Bayesian Inference.

Suppose you would like to decide whether to go to on a picnic tomorrow.
You have some data about the weather in the area. You know the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The probability of rain, $\Prob[R] = 0.2$
\item The probability you see clouds the day before it rains, $\Prob[C|R] = 0.75$
\item The probability you see clouds the day before a clear day, $\Prob[C|\overline{R}] = 0.1$
\end{itemize}
You notice heavy clouds in the sky. If you could calculate the probability that it will rain tomorrow conditioned on the clouds in the sky tonight, then you can make a more informed decision about tomorrow's plans.

You want to calculate $\Prob[R | C]$, the probability that it rains tomorrow if it is cloudy tonight. You remember that by  Bayes' formula, 
\[
\Prob[R|C] = \frac{\Prob[C|R]\Prob[R]}{\Prob[C]}.
\]
You do not know $\Prob[C]$. But, you know that 
\[
\Prob[C] = \Prob[C \cap \overline{R}] + \Prob[C \cap R].
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item  You can compute $\Prob[C \cap R]$ from the known quantities above. Recall that
\[
\Prob[C \cap R] = \Prob[C|R]\Prob[R]
\] 
What is $\Prob[C \cap R]$? Enter your answer as an exact decimal with a leading zero.
\begin{Freeform}{0.15}
$\Prob[C \cap R]$ = 
\Hint Do you know each of these quantites? Refer to your data above.
\Solution We know that $\Prob[C \cap R] = \Prob[C|R]\Prob[R]=0.75\times 0.2 = 0.15$.
\end{Freeform}
%-------------------------------------------
\item Now, you can compute $\Prob[C \cap \overline{R}]$:
\[
\Prob[C \cap \overline{R}] = \Prob[C|\overline{R}]\Prob[\overline{R}]
\] 
What is  $\Prob[C \cap \overline{R}]$? Enter your answer as an exact decimal with a leading zero.
\begin{Freeform}{0.08}
$\Prob[C \cap \overline{R}]$ = 
\Hint Do you know each of these quantites? Refer to your data above.
\Solution We have $\Prob[C\cap \overline{R}] = \Prob[C|\overline{R}]\Prob[\overline{R}]=0.1\times (1-0.2)=0.08$.
\end{Freeform}
%-----------------------------------
\item Finally, calculate $\Prob[R|C] = \frac{\Prob[C|R]\Prob[R]}{\Prob[C \cap \overline{R}] + \Prob[C \cap R]}$. Enter your answer as a decimal with a leading 0 and 2 decimal place's percision (i.e. $0.xy$ where $x,y$ are digits). 
\begin{Freeform}{0.65}
$\Prob[R|C]$ = 
\Hint Refer to your Bayes' formula above, and plug in your known quantities. 
\Solution We have calculated the numerator already. It is $0.15$. The denominator is the sum of two terms, each of which has already been computed. So the denominator is $0.15+0.08=0.23$. Therefore the probability $\Prob[R|C]$ is simply $0.15/0.23\simeq 0.65$.
\end{Freeform}
%-----------------------------------
\item Your prior was $\Prob[R]$, the probability that it rains tomorrow. Assuming you do not want to get rained on, will you be more or less likely to go on a picnic tomorrow considering your posterior probability $\Prob[R|C]$? 
\begin{Choices}
Is the posterior probability that it will rain greater than $0.5$? Was the prior probability greater than $0.5$?
\begin{itemize}
\FalseChoice\item More
\TrueChoice\item Less
\end{itemize}
\Solution Since the posterior is greater, it will be more likely to rain tomorrow, and therefore we should be less likely to go on a picnic.
\end{Choices}
%-----------------------------------
\end{enumerate}
\item {\bf Which is the biased coin?} In this problem, we will use Bayesian 
inference to try and distinguish a biased coin from a fair coin.

Suppose I have 2 coins. Let's call them $A$ and $B$. Coin $A$ is
unbiased,~\ie,~when you flip it, it comes up with a heads with probability
exactly $0.5$, or about half the time. Coin $B$ is biased. When you flip it, it
comes up with a heads with probablility $0.75$, or about three fourths of the
time.

The problem is that outwardly, the two coins are identical and
indistinguishable. I can't tell which is which just by looking at them, or
weighing them, or subjecting them to any physical test. All I can do is flip the
coins many times, and hope to tell them apart based on the outcomes of these
flips.

\begin{enumerate}
%-------------------------------------------
\item{So I pick up one of these coins at random and flip it a $100$ times, and I get 
    $50$ heads.}
\begin{Choices} 
Given the outcome above, what is the probability that the coin I picked is 
unbiased?
\begin{itemize}
\FalseChoice\item 0.0
\FalseChoice\item 0.5
\FalseChoice\item 1.0
\TrueChoice\item $\frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{50}}$

\FalseChoice\item $\frac{\dbinom{100}{50}\frac{1}{2^{100}}}{\dbinom{100}{75} \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{100} + \dbinom{100}{50} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{100}}$

\end{itemize}
\Solution Let $A$ be the event that I get $50$ flips out of the $100$, and let $B$ be the event that I pick the unbiased coin. Then $\Prob[B]=0.5$. We also have $\Prob[A|B]=\binom{100}{50}(1/2)^{100}$, since there are $\binom{100}{50}$ ways to pick the $50$ heads and each such configuration happens with probability $(1/2)^{100}$.

We also have $\Prob[A|\overline{B}]=\binom{100}{50}(3/4)^{50}(1/4)^{50}$ since if we pick the biased coin, there are again $\binom{100}{50}$ configurations with $50$ heads and each occurs with probability $(3/4)^{50}(1/4)^{50}$.

Now using the Bayes' formula we have
$$\Prob[B|A] = \frac{\Prob[A|B]\Prob[B]}{\Prob[A|B]\Prob[B]+\Prob [A| \overline{B}]\Prob[\overline{B}]} =
\frac{\Prob[A|B]\times 0.5}{\Prob[A|B]\times 0.5 + \Prob[A|\overline{B}]\times 0.5}$$

And the last part is equal to
$$\frac{(1/2)^{100}}{(1/2)^{100}+(3/4)^{50}(1/4)^{50}}$$
which can be further simplified into $\frac{1}{1+(3/4)^{50}}$.

\item{Now I pick up the other coin and flip \textit{it} a $100$ times, 
    and I get $75$ heads.}
\begin{Choices} 
    Given the two outcomes above (\ie,~the heads counts from both sets of $100$ 
    flips), what is the probability that the first coin that I picked is 
    unbiased?
\begin{itemize}
\FalseChoice\item 0.0
\FalseChoice\item 0.5
\FalseChoice\item 1.0
\FalseChoice\item $\frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{50}}$
\FalseChoice\item $\frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{100}}$
\FalseChoice\item $\frac{\dbinom{100}{50}\frac{1}{2^{100}}}{\dbinom{100}{75} \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{100} + \dbinom{100}{50} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{100}}$
%\TrueChoice\item $\frac{\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{25}}{\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{25} + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{25}}$
\TrueChoice\item $\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{25}}$
\end{itemize}
\Solution Same as before, we just need to use the Bayes' formula. If $C$ is the event of seeing 75 heads for the second coin, then $\Prob[C|\overline{B}] = \binom{100}{75}(1/2)^{100}$ and $\Prob[C|B]=\binom{100}{75}(3/4)^{75}(1/4)^{25}$.

Note that $A$ and $C$ are independent conditioned on $B$, meaning that once we fix whether we picked the biased coin or the unbiased coin, the two events $A$ and $C$ become independent (since they involve two series of unrelated coin tosses). So we have $\Prob[A\cap C|B]=\Prob[A|B]\Prob[C|B]$ and similarly $\Prob[A\cap C|\overline{B}]=\Prob[A|\overline{B}]\Prob[C|\overline{B}]$. We need $\Prob[B|A\cap C]$. We can again use the Bayes' formula and we end up with

$$\Prob[B|A\cap C] = \frac{(1/2)^{100}\times (3/4)^{75}(1/4)^{25}}{(1/2)^{100}\times (3/4)^{75}(1/4)^{25} + (3/4)^{50}(1/4)^{50}\times (1/2)^{100}}$$

This further simplifies into $\frac{1}{1+(1/3)^{25}}$.

\item {\bf Accounting fraud. }There are $3$ ways a CEO can 
    commit accounting fraud:~(a)~he can overstate revenue by booking fake 
    orders,~(b)~he can overstate profits by recording near-term expenses as 
    long-term capital expenses, and~(c)~he can understate liabilities by making 
    overly optimistic assumptions about the growth prospects of the company's 
    pension funds. In the United States, $50\%$ of CEOs commit fraud~(a), $20\%$ 
    of CEOs commit fraud~(b), $15\%$ of CEOs commit both fraud~(a) and 
    fraud~(b), and all CEOs commit fraud~(c).
    
    The probability of getting caught if a CEO does~(a) is $0.01$, independent 
    of whether or not he commits other kinds of fraud. Similarly, the 
    probability of getting caught if he does~(b) is $0.05$, and of getting 
    caught if he does~(c) is $0.001$.
    
\begin{enumerate}
%-------------------------------------------
    \item{What are the chances (rounded to 2 decimal places) that a CEO who 
            perpetrates all $3$ kinds of fraud will get caught?}
\begin{Choices}
\begin{itemize}
\FalseChoice\item 0.21
\FalseChoice\item 0.76
\TrueChoice\item 0.06
\FalseChoice\item 0.01
\FalseChoice\item 0.00
\end{itemize}
\Solution If $A, B, C$ are the events of getting caught for each of the three frauds, then we are interested in $\Prob[A\cup B\cup C]$. But note that this is simply $1-\Prob[\overline{A}\cap \overline{B}\cap \overline{C}]$. Since $\overline{A}, \overline{B}, \overline{C}$ are independent, we have $\Prob[\overline{A}\cap \overline{B}\cap \overline{C}]=(1-0.01)(1-0.05)(1-0.001)\simeq 0.94$. Therefore $\Prob[A\cup B\cup C]\simeq 0.06$.
\end{Choices}

\item{You read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that the CEO of 
    TrustMe, Inc. (for all practical purposes, a randomly chosen CEO) has been 
    arrested for accounting fraud. What are the chances (rounded to $2$ decimal 
    places) that this CEO perpetrated at least $2$ kinds of fraud?}
\begin{Choices}
\begin{itemize}
\FalseChoice\item 0.00
\FalseChoice\item 0.95
\FalseChoice\item 1.00
\FalseChoice\item 0.33
\TrueChoice\item 0.97
\end{itemize}
\Solution We can partition the sample space into $4$ parts. Let's call the CEOs who perpetrate all frauds $D$, the ones who perpetrate only type (a) and (c) as $E$, the ones who perpetrate only type (b) and (c) as $F$, and the ones who perpetrate only type (c) as $G$. Also let $A, B, C$ be the events of being arrested for frauds of type (a), (b), (c) respectively. Then we are interested in $\Prob[D\cup E\cup F|A\cup B\cup C]$. To use the Bayes' formula we need compute $\Prob[A\cup B\cup C|x]\Prob[x]$ where $x$ ranges over $D, E, F, G$.

We have $\Prob[A\cup B\cup C|D] = (1-(1-0.01)(1-0.05)(1-0.001))$ and $\Prob[D]=0.15$. Therefore $\Prob[A\cup B\cup C|D]\Prob[D]\simeq 0.009$.

We have $\Prob[A\cup B\cup C|E] = (1-(1-0.01)(1-0.001))$ and $\Prob[E]=0.5-0.15=0.35$. Therefore $\Prob[A\cup B\cup C|E]\Prob[E]\simeq 0.00385$.

We have $\Prob[A\cup B\cup C|F] = (1-(1-0.05)(1-0.001))$ and $\Prob[F]=0.2-0.15=0.05$. Therefore $\Prob[A\cup B\cup C|F]\Prob[F]\simeq 0.00255$.

We have $\Prob[A\cup B\cup C|G] = 0.001$ and $\Prob[G] = 1-\Prob[D]-\Prob[E]-\Prob[F]=0.45$. Therfore $\Prob[A\cup B\cup C|G]\Prob[G] = 0.00045$.

Now using the Bayes' formula we get

$$\Prob[D\cup E\cup F|A\cup B\cup C] = \frac{0.009+0.00385+0.00255}{0.009+0.00385+0.00255+0.00045} \simeq 0.97.$$

So the chances are roughly 97\%.
\end{Choices}
%-------------------------------------------
\item{What are the chances (rounded to $2$ decimal 
    places) that the above CEO perpetrated exactly $2$ kinds of fraud?}
\begin{Choices}
\begin{itemize}
\TrueChoice\item 0.40
\FalseChoice\item 0.60
\FalseChoice\item 0.20
\FalseChoice\item 0.10
\FalseChoice\item 1.00
\end{itemize}
\Solution This time we are interested in $\Prob[E\cup F|A\cup B\cup C]$. We can reuse the computations from last time and the Bayes' formula to get

$$\Prob[E\cup F|A\cup B\cup C]=\frac{0.00385+0.00255}{0.009+0.00385+0.00255+0.00045}\simeq 0.40.$$

So the chances are roughly 40\%.

\item Oski the bear has lost his dog in either forest $A$ (with  
prior probability 0.4) or in forest $B$ (with prior probability 0.6). \\*                   
On any given day, if the dog is in $A$ and Oski spends a day searching 
for it in $A$, the probability that he will find the dog 
that day is 0.25. Similarly, if the dog is in $B$ and Oski spends a day 
looking for it there, the probability that he will find the 
dog that day is 0.15. \\*               
The dog cannot go from one forest to the other. Oski can search only in 
the daytime, and he can travel from one forest to the other only at night.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In which forest should Oski look to maximize the probability he 
finds his dog on the first day of the search?
  \begin{Choices}
  \begin{itemize}
    \TrueChoice\item Forest A
    \FalseChoice\item Forest B
  \end{itemize}
  \Solution Let $A$ denote the event that dog is in forest A. Let $B$ denote the event that dog is in forest B. 

  Let $S$ be the event that Oski successfully found the dog. 

  If Oski searches in Forest A, probability of finding the dog is 
  $P(A \cap S) = P(A) * P(S | A) = 0.4 * 0.25 = 0.1$

  If Oski searches in Forest B, probability of finding the dog is 
  $P(B \cap S) = P(B) * P(S | B) = 0.6 * 0.15 = 0.09$

  $0.1 > 0.09$. so Oski should search in \textbf{Forest A}
  \end{Choices}

  \item Given that Oski looked in $A$ on the first day but didn’t find 
        his dog, what is the probability that the dog is in $A$? (round your answer to 2nd decimal place)
  \begin{Freeform}{0.33}
   \begin{align*}
  P(A &\mid \bar{S}) 
  \\ &= \dfrac{P(A \cap \bar{S})}{P(\bar{S})} 
  \\ &=  \dfrac{P(A) * P(\bar{S} | A)}{P(A) * P(\bar{S} | A) + P(B) * P(\bar{S} | B)} \\ 
  &= \dfrac{0.4 * 0.75 }{0.4 * 0.75 + 0.6 * 1} = 0.33   
  \end{align*}

  Note that $P(\bar{S} | B) = 1$ because Oski looked in forest A.
  \end{Freeform} 

  \item If the dog is alive and not found by the first day of search, 
        it will die that evening with probability $\frac{1}{3}$. Oski has 
        decided to look in $A$ for the first two days. What is the probability 
        that he will find a live dog for the first time on the second day? (round your answer to 2nd decimal place)
  \begin{Freeform}{0.05}
    Let $S_i$ denote the event that the search on $i$ th day is successful. Let $D_i$ denote the event that the dog is dead the end of the $i$th day.

    For Oski to find a live dog for the first time on the second day, four events have to happen simultaneously:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item the dog must be in A (event $A$)
    \item Oski must not have found it on the first day (event $\bar{S_1}$)
    \item It must not die the first evening (event $\bar{D_1}$)
    \item Oksi must find it on the second day (event $\bar{S_2}$)
    \end{itemize}

    Therefore
    \begin{align*}
        &P(\text{Oski find a live dog for the first time on the second day}) \\
        &= P(A \cap \bar{S_1} \cap \bar{D_1} \cap \bar{S_2}) \\
        &= P(A) P(\bar{S_1} | A) P(\bar{D_1}| A \cap \bar{S_1}) P(\bar{S_2} | A \cap \bar{S_1} \cap \bar{D_1}) \\
        &= 0.4 * 0.67 * 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.05
    \end{align*}

  \end{Freeform}


\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
