\config{name}{Infinity, Countability, and Computability}

\noindent{\bf Infinity and Countability}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Which of the following are true for the cardinality of the set $\{1,2,3\}$?
	\begin{Multi}
	\begin{itemize}
		\TrueChoice\item Finite.
		\TrueChoice\item Countable.
	\end{itemize}
	\Solution This is a finite set since it has only 3 elements. A set is countable if and only if there is a bijection between it and a subset of $\mathbb{N}$. But this is actually a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ itself. So the identity function is the desired bijection. In general any finite set is countable.
	\end{Multi}
	
	\item Which of the following are true for the cardinality of the set of multiples of $5$?
	\begin{Multi}
	\begin{itemize}
		\FalseChoice\item Finite.
		\TrueChoice\item Countable.
	\end{itemize}
	\Solution This set obviously has infinitely many elements since $5k$ for any $k\in\mathbb{N}$ is in it. The function $x\to \frac{x}{5}$ is a bijection between this set and the set of natural numbers. So this is a countable set.
	\end{Multi}


	\item Suppose that a set $S$ is countable. Which of the following are true about $S$?
	\begin{Multi}
	\begin{itemize}
		\TrueChoice\item Any subset of $S$ is also countable.
		\FalseChoice\item Any strict (not equal to $S$ itself) subset of $S$ is finite.
		\TrueChoice\item  If we add an element to $S$ it remains countable.
	\end{itemize}
	\Solution By definition there is a bijection between $S$ and some subset of $\mathbb{N}$. That same bijection restricted to any subset of $S$ is also a bijection between that subset and some subset of $\mathbb{N}$.
	
	It is not true that any strict subset of $S$ is finite. For example the set of natural numbers is countable, but the set of odd numbers is a strict subset which is not finite.
	
	If $S$ is finite, adding an element to it makes it finite. If $S$ is infinite, then there is a bijection between it and $\mathbb{N}$. Now when we add an element to $S$ we can shift everything up by $1$ (so if an element was being mapped to $x$, now it's mapped to $x+1$), and map the new element to the lowest element of $\mathbb{N}$, i.e. $0$.
	\end{Multi}

	\item Which of the following sets are uncountable?
	\begin{Multi}
	\begin{itemize}
		\TrueChoice\item The interval $[0, 1]$.
		\FalseChoice\item The total number of computer programs that could ever be written.
		\TrueChoice\item The interval $[0, 10]$.
		\TrueChoice\item The set of real numbers that have a digit $1$ when written down.
	\end{itemize}
	\Solution The interval $[0,1]$ can be shown to be uncountable using Cantor's diagonalization method.
	
	Every computer program is simply a finite sequence of characters. If we assign each character a natural number, then a computer program is just a finite sequence of natural numbers. These are countable, since there is a bijection between them and the polynomials with natural coefficients which was shown to be a countable set.
	
	There is a bijection between the interval $[0,10]$ and the interval $[0,1]$. Namely $x\to \frac{x}{10}$.
	
	The set of real numbers that have a digit $1$ in their representation obviously includes the set $[10,11]$ which is uncountable.
	\end{Multi}

	\item In what cases does a set $S$ have the same cardinality as the set $S'$ obtained from $S$ by adding an element to it?
	\begin{Multi}
	\begin{itemize}
		\FalseChoice\item If $S$ is finite.
		\TrueChoice\item If $S$ is countable and infinite.
		\TrueChoice\item If $S$ is uncountable and infinite.
	\end{itemize}
	\Solution When $S$ is finite, then $S$ plus one element has strictly larger cardinality.
	
	But when $S$ is infinite, we can extract an infinite sequence out of it by the following method: we pick an element $a_1$; there must be another element $a_2$; there must be another element $a_3$, and so on. This process never stops because $S$ is infinite. Now construct a bijection between $S$ and $S'$ by mapping each $a_i$ to $a_{i+1}$, mapping the new element to $a_1$, and mapping other elements to themselves. This shows that $S$ and $S'$ have the same cardinality.
	\end{Multi}

	\item Are these sets countably infinite/uncountably infinite/finite? Reminder: A bit string is a sequence of digits where each digit corresponds to either a 1 or a 0.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Finite bit strings of length exactly n.
		\begin{Choices}
		\begin{itemize}
			\TrueChoice\item Finite
			\FalseChoice\item Countably Infinite
			\FalseChoice\item Uncountably Infinite
		\end{itemize}
		\Solution Finite. There are 2 choices (0 or 1) for each bit, and n bits, so 
     	there are $2 \cdot 2 \cdot \ldots \cdot 2 = 2^n$ such bit strings.
		\end{Choices}

		\item All finite-length bit strings of length ranging from 1 to n.
		\begin{Choices}
		\begin{itemize}
			\TrueChoice\item Finite
			\FalseChoice\item Countably Infinite
			\FalseChoice\item Uncountably Infinite
		\end{itemize}
		\Solution Finite. Finite. By part (a), there are $2^1$ bit strings of length 1, $2^2$ of 
     	length 2, etc. Thus, there are $2^1 + 2^2 + \ldots + 2^n = 2^{n + 1}- 2$.
		\end{Choices}

		\item All bit strings of any finite length.
		\begin{Choices}
		\begin{itemize}
			\FalseChoice\item Finite
			\TrueChoice\item Countably Infinite
			\FalseChoice\item Uncountably Infinite
		\end{itemize}
		\Solution Countably infinite. We show there is an injection from the set to natural numbers and vice versa.

		There is an injection from all finite length bit string to natural numbers: We can list these strings as follows: \\*
		$(0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111, 0000, \ldots)$. 
		We map from the the bit string to its position in the list. 

		There is an injection from natural numbers to all finite length bit strings: We map every natural number to its binary representation -- $0 \rightarrow 0, 1 \rightarrow 1, 2 \rightarrow 10, 3 \rightarrow 11, \cdots$.

		Therefore, the set has the same cardinality as natural numbers and is countably infinite.
		\end{Choices}

		\item All infinite-length bit strings
		\begin{Choices}
		\begin{itemize}
			\FalseChoice\item Finite
			\FalseChoice\item Countably Infinite
			\TrueChoice\item Uncountably Infinite
		\end{itemize}
		\Solution Uncountably infinite. We can show that the set of all initinite-length bit strings $S$ has a cardinality at least as large as the set of real numbers between 0 and 1, which is uncountably infinite. In particular, we show $|S| \geq \mathbb{R}[0, 1]$ by constructing an injection from $\mathbb{R}[0, 1]$ to $S$: we map every real number between 0 and 1 to their binary representation. This is an injection because any two different real numbers between 0 and 1 will have different binary representations. 

		Bonus: In fact, we can further show $|S| \leq \mathbb{R}[0, 1]$ by constructing an injection the other way around, from $S$ to $\mathbb{R}[0, 1]$: For binary string $b_1b_2b_3 \cdots$, we map it to the real number 
		$\Sigma_{i=1} ^ {\infty} b_i * 3 ^ {-i}$. Note here we use base 2 instead (i.e. $\Sigma_{i=1} ^ {\infty} b_i  * 2 ^ {-i}$), the mapping would not be injective: string $1000 \cdots$ will map to $1/2$ and string $0111 \cdots$ will also map to $\Sigma_{i=2} ^ {\infty} 2 ^ {-i} = 1 / 2$.

		Therefore, the set of all infinite-length bit strings is uncountably infinite, and according to bonus, it has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{R}[0, 1]$. (You may wonder why we bother to show the set has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{R}[0, 1]$, don't all uncountably infinite set all have the same cardinality, i.e. the cardinality of real numbers? It turns out that there are uncountably infinite sets with strictly larger cardinality than real numbers!)
		\end{Choices}

		\item The Union of all finite-length and infinite-length bit strings.
		\begin{Choices}
		\begin{itemize}
			\FalseChoice\item Finite
			\FalseChoice\item Countably Infinite
			\TrueChoice\item Uncountably Infinite
		\end{itemize}

		\Solution Uncountably infinite. This set $S$ has a cardinality at least as large as $\mathbb{Z}[0, 1]$ as it's the union of a countably infinite set 
		(part c) and an uncountably infinite set with the same cardinality as $\mathbb{Z}[0, 1]$ (part d), so it is uncountably infinite.

		Bonus: In fact, we can further show $|S| \leq \mathbb{Z}[0, 1]$ by constructing an injection from $S$ to $\mathbb{Z}[0, 1]$. For a finite binary string $b_1b_2b_3 \cdots b_k$, we map it to the real number $\Sigma_{i=1} ^ k b_i * 4 ^ {-(i+1)}$. For a infinite binary string $b_1b_2b_3 \cdots$, we map it to the real number $4^{-1} + \Sigma_{i=1} ^ k b_i * 4 ^ {-(i+1)}$. We know this mapping is injective because a finite string and an infinite string will never map to the same number. In addition, two different finite strings will never map to the same number and two differnet infinite strings will never map to the same number. 

		Therefore, the union of all finite-length and infinite-length bit strings is uncountably infinite, and according to bonus, it has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{R}[0, 1]$.
		\end{Choices}

\end{enumerate}

\noindent{\bf Computability}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Why can't we solve the Halting problem by just simulating the given program on the given input and seeing if it stops?
	\begin{Multi}
	\begin{itemize}
		\FalseChoice\item Because we cannot simulate programs.
		\TrueChoice\item Because in case the answer is no, our simulation would never stop.
	\end{itemize}
	\Solution We can indeed simulate programs. That is what virtualization softwares that most people are familiar with do.
	
	The reason is that we need to output an answer no matter whether it's Yes or No. But if a program is not going to halt (in which case the answer is No), our simulation also never stops.
	\end{Multi}
