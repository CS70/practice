\begin{enumerate}
\item A monkey types at a 26-letter keyboard with one key corresponding to each of the lower-case English letters. Each keystroke is chosen independently and uniformly at random from the 26 possibilities. If the monkey types 1 million letters, what is the expected number of times the sequence "book" appears? (Round your answer to 2nd decimal place).
\begin{Freeform}{2.19}
\Solution 
Let $A$ be the random variable denoting the number of times "book" appears. There are $1000000 - 4 + 1 = 999997$ slots where "book" can appear. Let $A_i, i=1, 2, \cdots, 999997$ be the indicator of the event that "book" appears at the ith slot. 

Note $E[A_i] = P(\text{"book" appears at the ith slot}) = \frac{1}{26}^4$.

Then $E[A] = E[A_1 + \cdots + A_{999997}] = E[A_1] + \cdots + E[A_{999997}] = \frac{999997}{26^4} = 2.19$
\end{Freeform}

\item You are at a party with n friends. You have prepared n red solo cups labeled with their name. Before handing red cups to your friends, you pick up each cup and put a sticker on it with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, independent of other cups. You shuffle the cups, and hand them back to your friends. Let $X$ denote the number of people who get their own cup back with a sticker on it.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute $E(X)$.
\begin{Freeform}{0.5}
\Solution Let $X_i$ be the indicator of the event that the i-th person gets their own cup back with a sticker on it. 

$E[X_i] = P(\text{i-th person gets their own cup back with a sticker on it}) = \frac{1}{2n}$.

So $E[X] = E[X_1 + \cdots + X_{n}] = E[X_1] + \cdots + E[X_n] = n \frac{1}{2n} = \frac{1}{2}$.

\end{Freeform}


\item Compute $Var(X)$.
\begin{Freeform}{0.5}
\Solution $Var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2$. We've calculated $E(X)^2$ in the last part and need $E(X^2)$.

$$E(X^2) = E((X_1 + \cdots + X_n)^2) = \sum_{i=1}^{i=n}E(X_i^2) + \sum_{i \neq j} E(X_iX_j)$$

$$E(X_i^2) = P(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{2n}$$

$$E(X_iX_j) = P(X_i = 1 \cap X_j = 1) = P(X_i = 1 | X_j = 1) P(X_j = 1) = \frac{1}{2(n-1)} \frac{1}{2n}$$.

So $E(X^2) = \sum_{i=1}^{i=n}E(X_i^2) + \sum_{i \neq j} E(X_iX_j) = n \frac{1}{2n} + n(n-1) \frac{1}{2(n-1)} \frac{1}{2n} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$.

Hence, $Var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2 = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{2^2} = \frac{1}{2}$.

\end{Freeform}

\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\item Two friends have n books they would like to read. Each friend independently picks a random permutation of the books and read them in that order. They read one book per week, for n concesutive weeks. Let $X$ be the number of weeks in which both friends are reading the same book. Compute $Var(X)$.

\begin{Freeform}{1}
\Solution Let $X_i$ be the indicator of the event that both friends are reading the same book on week i. Note $X = \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$. 

We  want to find $Var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2$. 

First we calculate $E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^nE(X_i)$. Note $E(X_i) = P(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{n}$. So $E(X) = n \frac{1}{n} = 1$. 

Then we calculate $$E(X^2) = E((X_1 + \cdots + X_n)^2) = \sum_{i=1}^{i=n}E(X_i^2) + \sum_{i \neq j} E(X_iX_j)$$

$$E(X_i^2) = P(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{n}$$

$$E(X_iX_j) = P(X_i = 1 \cap X_j = 1) = P(X_i = 1 | X_j = 1) P(X_j = 1) = \frac{1}{n-1} \frac{1}{n}$$.

So $E(X^2) = \sum_{i=1}^{i=n}E(X_i^2) + \sum_{i \neq j} E(X_iX_j) = n \frac{1}{n} + n(n-1) \frac{1}{(n-1)n} = 1 + 1 = 2$.


Hence, $Var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2 = 2 - 1 = 1$.

\end{Freeform}

\item {\bf Expectation and Variance.} This problem will give you some practice calculating expectations and variances of random variables.

\item Suppose that the random variable $X$ takes on 3 values, $10, 25, 70$. Suppose $\Prob[X =10] = 0.5$, $\Prob[X = 25] = 0.2$, and $\Prob[X = 70] = 0.3$.

\end{Freeform}
\end{enumerate}
%-----------------------------------
\item Let $X, Y$ be random variables, let $a,b,c$ be constants, and let $\E[X] = x$ and $\E[Y] = y$. What is $\E[aX + bY + c]$?
\begin{Choices}

\item {\bf A Game--Part I.} This game will give you practice with some expectations. 
\begin{enumerate}
%-----------------------------------
\item Suppose I have a bag full of equal numbers of \$1 bills and \$5 bills. If I let you choose a bill uniformly at random from this bag, let $X$ be the random variable corresponding to your profit. What is your expected profit?
\begin{Freeform}{3}
$\E[X]$ = 
\Hint Review the definition of expectation.
\end{Freeform}
%-----------------------------------
\item Say that I now add a second bag, which has equal numbers of $\$10$ and $\$20$ bills. Let the random variable corresponding to your profit from this bag be $Y$. If I let you choose one bill from the first bag and one bill from the second bag, what is your expected proft?
\begin{Freeform}{18}
$\E[X + Y]$ = 
\Hint Review the definition of expectation and linearity of expectation.
\end{Freeform}
%-----------------------------------
\item Now, suppose I decide to charge you $\$2.50$ to draw a bill from the first bag, and \$15.50 to draw from the second bag. If you draw from both bags, what is your expected net profit?
\begin{Freeform}{0}
$\E[X + Y - 18]$ = 
\Hint Review the definition of expectation and linearity of expectation.
\end{Freeform}
%-----------------------------------
\item Given the pay scheme above (\$2.50 to draw from the first bag, \$15.50 to draw from the second bag) Which of the following actions gives the maximum expected profit?
\begin{Multi}
\begin{enumerate}
\TrueChoice \item Drawing from the first bag only.
\FalseChoice \item Drawing from the second bag only.
\FalseChoice \item Drawing from both bags.
\FalseChoice \item Drawing from neither bag.
\end{enumerate}
\end{Multi}
%-----------------------------------
\item As the designer of this game, I want your expected profit to be net negative. I have told you that the proportions of \$1 and \$5 bills in the bag are the same. However, I could lie to you and rig the game so that if I charge you \$2.50, your expected profit for drawing from the first bag is negative. What percentage of bills in the bag should be \$1 bils in order to make your expected profit $-\$1$ (round up to the nearest percent)?
\begin{Freeform}{88}
\% of \$1s? = 
\Hint Review the definition of expectation.
\end{Freeform}
%-----------------------------------
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\item {\bf A Game--Part II.} This problem will give you some practice with variances. 
\begin{enumerate}
%-----------------------------------
\item Recall the game from Part I: I have a bag full of equal numbers of \$1 bills and \$5 bills. If I let you choose a bill uniformly at random from this bag (without charging you a fee), let $X$ be the random variable corresponding to your profit. What is the variance of $X$?
\begin{Freeform}{4}
$\Var[X] = \E[X^2] - \E[X]^2$ = 
\Hint Review the definition of variance.
\end{Freeform}
%-----------------------------------
\item Say now that I have a new game, in which I do not make any claims about the composition of the bag. However, I do advertise that the {\bf average earnings for one round are \$3}, that {\bf the variance is 3}, and that each round is independent of the previous round. 

After playing the game $10$ times, your total earnings are $\$14$--you drew \$1 bills 9 out of 10 times. You suspect me of cheating customers at this game. Can you use expectation and variance to make a case against me? Intuitively the answer is yes--you can show that your earnings are consistently below the advertized expectation, in a way that is more extreme than the advertized variance predicts. 

This intuition can be formalized by \emph{Chebyshev's Inequality}. Chebyshev's Inequality states that for a random variable $X$, 
\[
\Pr[ |X - \E[X]| \ge a] \le \frac{\Var[X]}{a^2}.
\] 
\begin{enumerate}
%%-----------------------------------
\item Define $Y = \sum_{i=1}^{10}{\frac{1}{10}Y_i}$ to be the random variable corresponding to your average earnings, and let $Y_i$ be the random variable corresponding to your earnings the $i$th time you play. What is $\E[Y]$, if my claims about the expectation and variance are true? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.
\begin{Freeform}{3.00}
$\E[Y]$ =  
\Hint Remember linearity of expectation. Also, this is not for the 10 games you already played--this is the expected earnings for 10 arbitrary games.
\end{Freeform}
%%-----------------------------------
\item What is $\Var[Y]$, if my claims are correct? Recall your answer from problem 1c, and that each time you play is independent of the others. Enter your answer as a decimal with leading 0.
\begin{Freeform}{0.3}
$\Var[Y]$ =  
\Hint Remember how variances of sums of independent random variables behave.
\end{Freeform}
%%-----------------------------------
\item Let $|1.40- \E[Y]| = a$. Give an upper bound on the probability that $Y = \$1.40$  (if my claims about the expectation and variance are true), by using Chebyshev's Inequality to upper bound the probability that $|Y - \E[Y]| \ge a$. Give your answer as a decimal, rounding to the nearest hundredth.
\begin{Freeform}{0.12}
$\Pr[Y = \$1.40] \le \Pr[|Y - \E[Y]| \ge a] \le $  
\Hint Review the definition of expectation and linearity of expectation.
\end{Freeform}
%%-----------------------------------
\item Say you decided that this probability is not convincing enough. You decided to repeat the game 100 times, and after these 100 times you find that your average earnings are still \$1.40.

Define a new random variable corresponding to your average earnings, $Z =\sum_{i=1}^{100} \frac{1}{100} Z_i$, where $Z_i$ is your earnings on the $i$th round. Repeat the process above (calculate $\Var[Z]$, then use Chebyshev's Inequality) to give the best upper bound you can on the probability that $Z = \$1.40$. Give your answer as a decimal, rounding to the nearest hundredth.
\begin{Freeform}{0.01}
$\Pr[Z = \$1.40] \le  \Pr[|Z - \E[Z]| \ge a] \le$  
\Hint Review the definition of expectation and linearity of expectation.
\end{Freeform}
%%-----------------------------------
\item Even though the average is the same after 10 and 100 games, do you have a stronger case for my cheating after repeating the experiment more times?

\begin{itemize}
\TrueChoice \item Yes
\FalseChoice \item No
\end{itemize}
\end{Choices}

\item {\bf Meaningful Markov Inequality} Let $X \geq 0$ be a random variable with $E[X] = \mu$. If we upper bound $P(X \geq t)$ with Markov's inequality, what condition does $t$ need to satisfy for the bound to be meaningful?
\begin{Choices}
\Hint What is an upper bound for $P(X \geq t)$ true for any random variable?

\begin{itemize}
	\TrueChoice\item $t < \mu$
	\FalseChoice\item $t > \mu$
	\FalseChoice\item $t < \frac{1}{\mu}$
	\FalseChoice\item $t > \frac{1}{\mu}$

\end{itemize}
\Solution $P(X \geq t ) \leq \frac{\mu}{t}$. We want $\frac{\mu}{t} < 1$ to obtain a non trivial bound. 
\end{Choices}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\item Suppose $X$ is a random variable with mean 5 and variance 2.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Using Chebyshev's Inequality, derive an upper bound for $P(X \notin (3, 7))$.
	\begin{Freeform}{0.5}
	\Solution $P(|X - E(X)| \geq 2) \leq Var(X) / 2^2 = 2 / 4 = 1/2$

	\end{Freeform}

	\item Derive an upper bound for $P(X \notin (1, 7))$. 
	\begin{Freeform}{0.5}
	$P(X \notin (1, 7)) \leq P(X \notin (3, 7)) \leq 1/2$
	\end{Freeform}

	\item Derive an upper bound for $P(X \geq 7)$.
	\begin{Freeform}{0.5}
	$P(X \geq 7) \leq P(X \notin (3, 7)) \leq 1/2$
	\end{Freeform}


	\item Suppose we knew, in addition that X follows a symmetric distribution. That is, for any $k > 0$, $P(X \geq  E(X) + k) = P(X \leq  E(X) - k)$. Derive an upper bound on $P(X \geq 7)$.

	\begin{Freeform}{0.25}
	$\leq P(X \notin (3, 7)) = P(X \geq 7) + P(X \leq 3) = 2P(X \geq 7) \leq 1/2$. So $P(X \geq 7) \leq 1/4$
	\end{Freeform}



\end{enumerate}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\item Assume that each Berkeley student is a CS major independently with probability p. We want to estimate p as follows: We sample n students and observe the fraction of students that are CS major among them is $\hat{p}$. Let $\hat{p}$ be our estimator of $p$. Using Chebyshev's inequality, how large must n be to ensure that $P(p \in [\hat{p} - \epsilon, \hat{p} + \epsilon]) \geq 1 - \delta$, given $\epsilon = 0.1$ and $\delta = 0.05$? 

\begin{Freeform}{500}
\Solution $Var(\hat{p}) = \frac{1}{n} p(1-p) \leq \frac{1}{4n} $. So by Chebyshev's inequality
$$P(|p - \hat{p}| \geq \epsilon) \leq \frac{Var(\hat{p})}{\epsilon^2} \leq \frac{1}{4n\epsilon^2}$$

To ensure $P(p \in [\hat{p} - \epsilon, \hat{p} + \epsilon]) \geq 1 - \delta$, it's sufficient to set $\frac{1}{4n\epsilon^2} \leq \delta$. Thus, it's sufficient to let $n \geq \frac{1}{4\epsilon^2\delta} = \frac{1}{0.1^20.05} = 500$.
\end{Freeform}
